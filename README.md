Boxguage is a semi-programming language. 
It's more like a framework to simplify the basic scripting 
to appeal to non-programmers.

The main idea behind the Boxguage is that 
user instead of coding with functions and self made classes
uses special objects (boxes) with predefined internal methods,
that modify given input and generate output.

One box accepts up to 4 iputs and produces only one (or 0)
outputs.
Each box has 4 ports to communicate with other boxes which can
be used to create complex programs. Port can be turned on and off.

In planning stage is also an app, that visually arranges boxes in a grid,
giving the programmer the better view of a structore of his program.
At some point the app should enable visual scripting.
